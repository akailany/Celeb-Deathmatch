# Celeb-Deathmatch
A C# comic 2D fighter game on the Unity engine. Game supports various combat movements as well as sound feedback and winner celebrations. The only two characters at the moment are Trump and Hillary. I plan on adding more celebrity characters and tailor their fighting styles to things they're known for.
